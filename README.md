# Fibonacci_GPU
A GPU Threaded solution to the Recursive Fibonacci Sequence.

Note: This program isn't meant to be useful, the Fibonacci Sequence is my general go to for learning Recursion and Threading on a new language.  Threading the recursive solution to the Fibonacci Sequence is still very inefficient, and is not practical in any way.
